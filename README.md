# GE1-Assignment
 

For my assignment I an going to make a 3D audio visualiser that will look like you are moving
through a neon kaleidoscope. In it i want to make it look like the camera is moving though a tunnel 
with particles and objects surrounding you leaving trails in different shapes. The generation
and look of the particles and shapes around you will change with the music tempo and what frequencies
are being played. A similar looking project I have found from looking through last years projects
is by [Daniel  Hederman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxqISvYzKc4&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E5qaYwUOlJ63XI2OR9ty7Bs&index=27)

Mine will have a similar idea in that it will be a tunnel and it will look like you are moving 
through it but mine will differ in the shapes it is creating and how it visualises the music etc.
